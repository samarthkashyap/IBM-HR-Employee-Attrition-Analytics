# IBM_HR_Analytics

The objective of this initiative is to unveil the determinants contributing to job environment among employees in the organization. It aims to address crucial inquiries such as analyzing the distribution of distance from home based on job roles, or comparing average monthly income in relation to education and gender in order to make informed business decisions. The attrition rate, often regarded as the inverse retention rate, stands out as the predominant metric in attrition analysis. This metric is commonly calculated by assessing the number of employees lost annually relative to the total employee base. The realm of HR analytics is rapidly gaining prominence, offering the potential to transform HR departments into highly data-driven entities, thereby significantly enhancing their operational efficiency. We employed a combination of SQL and MongoDB queries to extract pertinent information regarding the impact of various factors towards business. This approach allowed us to address key questions influencing attrition outcomes and derive insights into the dynamics at play within the employee landscape.
