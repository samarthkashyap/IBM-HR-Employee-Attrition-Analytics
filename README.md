# IBM_HR_Analytics

The objective of this initiative is to unveil the determinants contributing to employee attrition. It aims to address crucial inquiries such as analyzing the distribution of distance from home based on job roles and attrition, or comparing average monthly income in relation to education and attrition. The attrition rate, often regarded as the inverse retention rate, stands out as the predominant metric in attrition analysis. This metric is commonly calculated by assessing the number of employees lost annually relative to the total employee base. The realm of HR analytics is rapidly gaining prominence, offering the potential to transform HR departments into highly data-driven entities, thereby significantly enhancing their operational efficiency.
